#This is an ATMEL Mega328P / NRF24L01+ based 2.4GHz radio receiver
## Features:
- 4 RC servo connectors
- integrated TB6612FNG dual dc motor driver
- serial header
- I2C header
- ICSP header for programming with Arduino IDE (use "TheDIYGuy999 328P" board definition and set brownout voltage to 1.8V)
- NRF24L01+ SMD module integrated
- very small size
- Eagle files are also provided, if you want to build your own receiver!

New in V 1.3:
- Vehicle configuration is now stored in "vehicleConfig.h", so the main code always stays the same.
- Crude frequency hopping, if bad receiving quality is detected (needs to be improved).

New in V 1.4:
- 10 vehicle addresses instead of 5
- More vehicle configuration options
- The "BACK" button on the transmitter can now be used (if the menu screen is not displayed on the OLED) as a momentary button, for example for a horn on the vehicle. It is sent as "data.momentary1"
- SimpleTimer library replaced with my own code, which uses significantly less memory

New in V 1.5:
- Added steering mixer for semi caterpillar and caterpillar vehicles such as tanks, diggers etc.
- Channel 3 is throttle, channel 1 is steering
- More vehicle configuration options in vehicleVonfig.h
- The left caterpillar is motor 2, the right is motor 1
- Steering servo 1 can be used in parallel (for semi caterpillar vehicles or vehicles with electronic differential)

New in V 1.6:
- Added indicator lights - wired to A4 (SDA) / A5 (SCL) ports
- enabled and disabled left / right by channel 4 left / right
- disabled by turning back the steering wheel (channel 1) - just like a real car
- hazard lights (all indicators flashing), if no connection to the transmitter

New in V 1.61:
- Battery cutoff bug fixed
